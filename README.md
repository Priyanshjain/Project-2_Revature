# Project 2
# Patient Onboarding - Angular/Spring
Allow patients to submit and update patient information and store it securely making on- boarding faster and reliable. Define the desired capabilities (i.e. requirements) of this portal. The requirements should be ideally expressed from the perspective of a patient who wants to visit the hospital/clinic for consultation and/or procedure. You can choose a general practitioner or dental practice or eye clinic or any other. Patient onboarding regulations should be researched and built into the application.
